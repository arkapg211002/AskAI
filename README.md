# AskAI
An application that resembles ChatGPT made using OpenAI API.

Previously threw 401 errors
Solution that worked:
1. Remove .gitignore file from root folder
2. Remove .env file from script folder
3. Make new API Key
4. Add API Key in environment variable of remote server and deploy again
5. Made a new vercel deployment

**[Request]:- Please don't use it to the limit as it is running on free trial**

**The risk factor set is low that is it will not think out of the box and the frequency of getting slightly same answers is also set to be low, good for getting facts, codes and explanations.**
